Flappy Bird with Genetic Algorithm
Flappy Bird is a simple game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through obstacles by flapping its wings to avoid collision. One interesting application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to this game is to use a genetic algorithm to evolve an AI agent that can play the game automatically and achieve high scores.

In a genetic algorithm, a population of agents is created, each with a set of parameters that determine its behavior in the game. These parameters are then evolved over multiple generations through a process of selection, crossover, and mutation, with the goal of improving the performance of the agents.

In the case of Flappy Bird, the AI agent can be represented as a neural network, with the inputs being the bird's position, velocity, and distance to the nearest obstacle, and the output being the decision to flap or not. The genetic algorithm then evolves the weights of the neural network, with higher scores in the game leading to higher fitness and thus a higher likelihood of being selected for the next generation.

By repeating this process over multiple generations, the AI agent can learn to play the game at a high level, and even outperform human players in some cases. This approach has been used in various studies and competitions, and can serve as an interesting example of the application of AI to a simple game environment.
